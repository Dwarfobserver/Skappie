# Skappie

This is a personal project : a 2D network game engine. For now, it is almost empty.

It's developped with MSVC and Visual Studio and uses recent C++ features.

The solution has four projects :
 - common, a library used by all three other projects
 - client, the Skappie client
 - server, the Skappie server (gnn)
 - tests, source files filled of Catch2 test cases
